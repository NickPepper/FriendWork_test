## Welcome to Reactive DataTables!

This is the test made for the [&laquo;FriendWork&raquo;](https://friend.work/) company by Nick Pepper.<br>

As a smart table was jQuery's [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) used.


This project uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for handling all assets.



## After cloning this repository you should do at first:

#### `$ npm install`


<br>
<br>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `$ npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `$ npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

#### `$ npm test -- --coverage`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode AND shows the test coverage report.

#### `$ npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
The app is ready to be deployed!

#### `$ npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

You don’t have to ever use `eject`.

#### `$ npm run flow`

Flow is a static type checker that helps you write code with fewer bugs. Check out this [introduction to using static types in JavaScript](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/why-use-static-types-in-javascript-part-1-8382da1e0adb) if you are new to this concept.<br>
To learn more about Flow, check out [its documentation](https://flowtype.org/).



## Post-Processing CSS

This project minifies all CSS and adds vendor prefixes to it automatically through [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) so you don’t need to worry about it.

For example, this:

```css
.App {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
}
```

becomes this:

```css
.App {
  display: -webkit-box;
  display: -ms-flexbox;
  display: flex;
  -webkit-box-orient: horizontal;
  -webkit-box-direction: normal;
      -ms-flex-direction: row;
          flex-direction: row;
  -webkit-box-align: center;
      -ms-flex-align: center;
          align-items: center;
}
```



## Using HTTPS in Development

To do this, set the `HTTPS` environment variable to `true`, then start the dev server as usual with `npm start`:

#### Windows (cmd.exe)

```cmd
set HTTPS=true&&npm start
```

(Note: the lack of whitespace is intentional)

#### Linux, macOS (Bash)

```bash
HTTPS=true npm start
```

Note that the server will use a self-signed certificate, so your web browser will almost definitely display a warning upon accessing the page.
